I was always more of a numbers person - graduated from UT Austin with a degree in economics and a minor in math and business, briefly pursued a masters in environmental econ, and then realized I didn’t dream of running regressions behind a desk. Enter: quarter-life crisis. I made some earrings for the gift shop inside my father’s restaurant, and the rest is history. (If it’s history you’re interested in - head on over to our ROPE STORY page!)<br\/><br\/>These days, I’m inspired by creating, overcoming chaos, and connecting with the Tula community. Outside of the Tula Blue workshop, you can find me with my boys. They are my world. ‘Tula’ means balance and isn’t that what it’s all about? I will forever be working on that work\/play\/life balance and trying my best to juggle it all - my business, my marriage, my three boys, and of course, my fur baby, Willow. <br\/><br\/>We’re now settled back in Austin, TX close to family and we really enjoy our lake and trail time. (Don’t worry— Tula Blue’s roots and original workshop will forever be on North Padre Island, TX!)<\/p><p>I love what I do and what we’ve built. A couple of years ago I was chatting with my husband about what we would do if we won the lottery, and I could honestly say I would keep my day job. I stand by that. Running this small business is a dream come true, and I’m so proud of what we’ve become. We strive to be a give-back, do-good brand. Tula Blue is a company that cares about community. Community at-large, and community within the company. Tula Blue has grown into a tribe of almost 20 awesome ladies, most of whom are also busy moms, working together to create the perfect jewelry to bring a bit of balance to your beautiful life. I’m not sure how I got so lucky to work with these amazing women.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["1658346154845ff867-0","1658346154845ff867-1"],"settings":{"align_text":"center","narrow_column":true,"divider":false}},"1658346302f66d576a":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Sara_Garner_1296x_266f10cb-49b9-4d19-8597-ad48bc815df4.jpg","image_width":410,"subtitle":"VP of Graphics & Miscellaneous Stuff","title":"Sara Garner","text":"<p>I asked Sara to help out at an Island Market back in 2016.

She’s an insanely talented maker, from helping me make all the orders at our dining table for the very first 12 Days of a Tula Blue Christmas sale, to being by my side over the last few years as we expanded Tula to new markets. Now our full-time graphic designer, she’s fantastic behind a camera lens and unstoppable with an Apple Pencil. We both left Corpus Christi in 2019, so we work together remotely, spending hours on the phone every day. Somehow, it just works.
