Hoping to turn this passion into a reality, Davidson launched his eponymous line in 2007.<br\/><br\/>Since its inception, the Dean Davidson brand has risen to international prominence, counting Oprah, Jennifer Lopez, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, and the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, as fans. Further solidifying his role as an internationally celebrated jewelry designer, Davidson was honoured as the Canadian Arts & Fashion Award’s 2019 Accessories Designer of the Year.<br\/><br\/>As a truly international brand, Davidson’s designs draw inspiration from his extensive world travels. His collections are purposefully designed in Toronto, Canada and meticulously crafted in a traditional, family-owned workshop of multi-generational master gem cutters in Jaipur, India.<br\/><br\/>Each piece is cast out of high-quality brass, finished in 22kt gold or rhodium, and set with custom-cut, semi-precious gemstones. The collection’s signature brushed finish - a technique learned by the designer during time spent in Paris - gives a timeless, luxurious, and unique quality to each design.<\/p>","text_size":1,"text_columns":1,"align_text":"text-left","button_text":"","button_url":"","button_color":"btn--neutral","button_style":"caps--link","text_color":"text--neutral","bg_color":"#fafafa"}}},"block_order":["163216768011f0d18d-1","163216768011f0d18d-0"],"settings":{"height":"image-height","padding":false,"borders":false,"wrapper":false}},"icons":{"type":"section-icons","disabled":true,"blocks":{"icons-0":{"type":"icon_block","settings":{"icon_name":"icon-rating","icon_color":"#aaaaaa","title":"Lifetime Warranty","text":"<p>Dean Davidson jewelry is designed and handcrafted to last a lifetime. <\/p>"}},"icons-1":{"type":"icon_block","settings":{"icon_name":"icon-shipment-world","icon_color":"#aaaaaa","title":"FREE SHIPPING","text":"<p>We are happy to offer free shipping across CA & USA.<\/p>"}},"icons-2":{"type":"icon_block","settings":{"icon_name":"icon-basket-return","icon_color":"#aaaaaa","title":"FREE & EASY RETURNS","text":"<p>Free 30 day returns and 60 day exchanges within Canada.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["icons-0","icons-1","icons-2"],"settings":{"title":"","bg":"section bg--accent","icon_size":"icon--medium","icon_alignment":"icon--top","align_text":"text-left"}},"main":{"type":"page","disabled":true,"settings":{"kicker":"","show_title":false,"show_content":true,"text_size":2,"align_text":"text-left","height":"margin--small","width":"wrapper","text_color":"text--neutral","bg":"section bg--neutral"}}},"order":["hero","1632167954195f0ce2","163216768011f0d18d","icons","main"]}
