<div data-label="Text Block"> <div class="elm text-edit"><p>We try our best to grade our Pops accurately so you know what to expect your Pop and its box to look like. Obviously, grading is subjective and not everybody will see things the same way, so if you buy a Pop from us and don't agree with our condition grade please reach out to us and we will do our best to make things right. We're not happy until you are.</p>
<p>This is a general guide as to what each grade from 1 to 10 will look like and the damage we look for:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> - The Box and/or Pop will look almost completely destroyed. We will probably never sell a Pop with a box that looks like a 1, so you most likely don't need to worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> - The box will have severe damage on pretty much every side, and will exhibit tears in the card board and may be missing pieces of the box. Might as well be out-of-box.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> - The box will exhibit at least a few of the following: mild to moderate tears, multiple crushed corners, stains, and/or severe window damage.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> - The box will be crushed in multiple areas, may exhibit tears, have heavy creases in multiple areas, have moderate window damage, and one or two crushed corners.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> - The box may be crushed in one or two spots, have very heavy shelf wear, a heavy tear/cut, have moderate to heavy window damage, have a tear, multiple  creases, and/or have have crushed corners.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> - The box may show heavy shelf wear, have multiple dinged or crushed corners, have window damage, minor scuffing, have multiple creases or a very minor tear/cut.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> - The box may exhibit light to moderate shelf wear, one minor crease, one or two dinged corners, heavy scratch or very minor window damage.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong> - The box will be very presentable and will show very little wear. Allowable damage for an 8 is one or two of the following: very minor shelf wear, one lightly dinged corner, one very light crease in a non-noticeable area, small scratch (from box-cutter or otherwise), or very light scuffing on the window or box.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> - A Pop that is nearly perfect. A 9 will only show very little shelf wear only upon close inspection.</p>
<p><strong>9.5</strong> - Pretty much perfect. We will never call any Pop a perfect 10, so a 9.5 is as good as it gets with us.</p>
<p>**Note #1: For the sake of our sanity, we do not try and split hairs between an 8, 9 or 10 on Pops that are under $40. Rather, we simply say "8 or better" for Pops, which we think 98% of collectors will be happy with. </p>
<p>****Note #2: The following are things we do not take into account when grading our Pops- blemishes in the paint job, rounded window (as opposed to one with a firm fold down the seam), retailer price stickers, and missing exclusive stickers (but it will be mentioned in the description if one is missing).</p>
