Our philosophy is that this is a hobby that is meant to be enjoyed by collectors, so when purchasing online there should be no underlying stress and the buyer should always have recourse. Our number one goal is to make sure our customers are happy with every order so that we can forge long-lasting relationships and become the best Pop shop on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We have time-tested packing standards that successfully limit damage in transit but sometimes it is simply unavoidable. If you ever encounter loss or damage in transit caused by a shipping carrier, please reach out to us as soon as possible within 14 days so that we can work with you on exchange, return and/or refund solutions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you have any issue whatsoever with your order just fill out the form on the 'Contact Us' page and we will get back to you within 24 hours.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>*RETURN SHIPPING:</strong> Who pays return shipping is decided on a case by case basis. If a mistake was made on our end then we're happy to pay shipping on the return. We try to be as fair as possible, but we also cannot take huge losses on orders when the error was not on our end.</em></p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>**POPSHIELD RETURN POLICY:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We are happy to accept returns or offer replacements in the event that you receive a defective PopShield protector if notified of the issue within 14 days of delivery. However, we cannot accept returns on PopShields that were ordered by mistake or do not fit a particular Pop. Each PopShield size has the measurements listed in the product title- if you have any doubt whether a Pop will fit then please measure to make sure.</em></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>***EXCEPTIONS:</strong> There are some items that we cannot offer returns on. These include mystery boxes and Signature Series Pops.</em></span></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><script>window.__gemStoreData = {};window.__gemStoreData.gemKeyValid = {};window.__gemStoreData.gemKeyValid.bestWayAddToCart = 1;window.__gemStoreData.gemKeyValid.pImageListSliderVimeo = 1;</script>
