Since the beginning, our pieces have been stitched together using a common thread: family. For 30 years, the business has remained family owned and operated. Launching first as a small boutique in Chinatown under the name Old Shanghai, to its recent transformation into KIM+ONO, the business has evolved and grown into the apparel brand it is today. The two women at the helm of our brand are sisters and co-founders, Renee and Tiffany Tam. All of our kimono patterns are designed in-house by Renee and Tiffany, and we work with a family-run silk village to produce these soft, <a href=\"https:\/\/kimandono.com\/collections\/kimono-robes-all\/material_silk?sort_by=title-ascending\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#99a4ae;\">silk kimono robes<\/a> for every woman to look just as beautiful as she feels. Our women’s kimono robes draw inspiration from the various styles of traditional Chinese brushwork, capturing the aesthetics (artistic principles) of depth, contrast, space, and balance. Many of our robes feature romantic, tranquil scenes of birds and or flowers that bear significance. For example, the lotus flower symbolizes good luck and fortune, a sentiment we wish to share with our customers. We created these women’s kimono robes to be the perfect complement to any outfit. No matter what the occasion, a silk kimono robe, plus size kimono robe, or floral kimono jacket is an easy way to dress up the same old wardrobe. In fact, just adding one floral kimono pattern to your closet can completely transform it. Soon, you may even start to look at your own closet as ready-to-wear art. And if that’s the case, then our handpainted silk kimono robes are a beautiful choice. These kimono robes each take seven days to make, as they’re first sketched by hand, then saturated in rich watercolors with a traditional paintbrush. You can read more about our handcrafted process <a href=\"https:\/\/kimandono.com\/blogs\/journal\/the-handpainted-kimono-pattern-process\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#99a4ae;\">here<\/a>, and then collect your favorite piece! We know that many of our customers have busy schedules and are constantly balancing their work and family life. So that’s why we created our Washable Silk Kimono Robe collection. Equal parts soft and sturdy, it’s perfect for a mother on the go, for nursing or during pregnancy. It’s also a great option for when you want to wear your silk kimono robe every day (and we understand if you do!), but don’t want to bring it to the dry cleaner every week. Our beautiful floral kimono robes are designed to make you feel incredible from the inside out. We know that you need special statement pieces that reflect the dynamic woman you are, and that’s just what our women’s kimono robes will do. Whether you wear yours as a light kimono cardigan over jeans and a tee, wear it as a stunning kimono dress wrapped with a belt and heels to make a statement, or simply wear it as loungewear while relaxing around your home with a cup of tea and a good book, we hope each and every kimono robe adds a little luxury to your every day.<\/p>\n<\/div>","full_width":true}},"logos":{"type":"section-logos","disabled":true,"blocks":{"logo-0":{"type":"logo_image","settings":{"link":""}},"logo-1":{"type":"logo_image","settings":{"link":""}},"logo-2":{"type":"logo_image","settings":{"link":""}},"logo-3":{"type":"logo_image","settings":{"link":""}},"logo-4":{"type":"logo_image","settings":{"link":""}}},"block_order":["logo-0","logo-1","logo-2","logo-3","logo-4"],"settings":{"title":"","bg":"section bg--neutral"}},"1655424616cd17c961":{"type":"section-richtext","settings":{"kicker":"","title":"","truncateChar":295,"text":"<p>Our unique collection of <a href=\"https:\/\/kimandono.com\/collections\/kimono-robes-all\">kimono robes<\/a> is inspired by Asian vintage art, beautiful blooms and our family history in Chinatown, San Francisco.
