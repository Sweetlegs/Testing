<div class="element-wrap" data-label="Text Block" id="e-1637003830398" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1637003830398"><div class="elm text-edit"><p>Q: Do you offer pre-orders on Funko Pops?</p><p><strong>A: No, we will only sell&nbsp;Funko Pops that we have in stock. Pre-sales can be messy, and in some cases the order never comes in or is smaller in quantity than anticipated. The last thing we want to do is tell you that you won't be getting the Pop you pre-ordered and have been eagerly awaiting through no fault of our own, so we choose to avoid that potential situation. The only products we may offer pre-orders on are our PopShield protectors.</strong></p><p>Q: The Pop I'm looking at says "Condition: 8 out of 10 or better". Does this mean it will come damaged?</p><p><strong>A: While we do grade all of our Pops and mention if there is any significant damage, we choose not to split hairs when it comes to 8/10, 9/10 and 10/10 because 98% of collectors would be perfectly happy with any of these conditions. Our 8/10 means that there might be very minor shelf wear at the absolute worst. However, on more expensive Pops ($50+) we will note the exact condition in our estimation. For more info on how we grade our Pops, please consult our <a href="/pages/condition-grading-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Condition Guide</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Q: How often do you add new Pops to the site?</p><p><strong>A: We add several hundred new Pops to the site every Sunday at 9pm eastern, Wednesday at 3pm eastern and Friday at 6pm eastern! But be ready because the harder to find ones sell quickly, usually within minutes or even seconds of going live. They can be found on our 'Newly Added' page the second they go live.</strong></p><p>Q: How do you price your Pops?<strong><br>A: We typically align our pricing with PPG (poppriceguide.com) since we've found them to be most accurate across the board. However, prices can be very volatile and we use our best judgement to determine what "fair market value" is if we feel PPG might be off on a particular Pop. Our goal is always to price our Pops fairly, rather than always trying to get top dollar like many Pop sellers. But we cannot always guarantee our prices will align perfectly with PPG or any other price guide.</strong></p><p>Q: What types of payments do you accept?</p><p><strong>A: We currently accept all major credit cards through our own&nbsp;credit card processor, as well as Paypal, Apple Pay and Amazon Pay.</strong></p><p>Q: How can you sell Pops below MSRP?</p><p><strong>A:&nbsp;All of our Pops have been purchased on the secondary market and not from Funko directly, therefore they cannot be considered 'New'. But this also means they can be sold for under the manufacturer's suggested retail price.</strong></p><p>Q: How quickly will you ship my Pop?</p><p><strong>A: <span>Our goal is&nbsp;for&nbsp;all purchases to be&nbsp;shipped&nbsp;within&nbsp;3&nbsp;business&nbsp;<wbr>days&nbsp;of&nbsp;purchase. There are occasions where there is a holiday, some unexpected logistical delay, or we receive more orders than anticipated and shipment might be delayed an extra day or two, but this is not the norm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>Q: Where are you located and do you have a store that customers can visit?</p><p><strong>A: We work out of a warehouse in Catonsville, MD. Unfortunately we do not allow walk-in business at this time. Low overhead is one of the reasons for our low prices, and a retail store would add significantly to our costs.</strong></p><p>Q: Do you offer returns?</p><p><strong>A: One of the things that sets us apart from our competitors is our no-questions-asked return policy for most products. If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, please reach out to us and we'll do what we can to make things right</strong><strong>. You can go here to view our <a href="/pages/refund-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Return Policy</a>.</strong></p><p>Q: Do you ship internationally?</p><p><strong>A:&nbsp;Yes, we ship almost everywhere!</strong></p><p>Q: Can my Pops be shipped inside a plastic Pop protector?</p><p><strong>A: Yes! Just click the checkbox on the product page and your new Pop will be shipped securely in a PopShield protector for an additional small fee.</strong></p><p>Q: Do you buy Pops?</p><p><strong>A: Absolutely! We are always looking to buy Pop collections. If you have a collection to sell, click the '<a href="/pages/we-buy-collections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Buy Collections!</a>' tab and fill out the form on that page.&nbsp;</strong></p></div></div><!--gfsplit--><script>window.__gemStoreData = {};window.__gemStoreData.gemKeyValid = {};window.__gemStoreData.gemKeyValid.bestWayAddToCart = 1;</script>
