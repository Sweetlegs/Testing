Go ahead, don’t worry, we won’t put dough on your nose. But remember a moment you were Brave. For Mary, one moment was founding a Bakery on her own in 1981. You may know the story, but that bravery allowed her to run her business on her own for the first 25 years and is the bedrock on which our humble success stands today. It may not have been apparent immediately following high school when studying under a master baker in Edinburgh’s Atholl Crescent School, that this skill, along with a family recipe, would put a roof over the heads of her two sons decades later. But that’s what happened. Truth be told, in under a year her “Joy” would reach Australia, Yugoslavia and Hong Kong, and be crowned atop Holt Renfrew’s list where it has stayed ever since.<\/p>\n                        <p>If you know our Maple Crunch, you may swear it’s magic, but the real magic came from that brave heart which set the groundwork for our business. As our world is now challenged like never before, we share her story of becoming a businesswoman, a leader, a creative force challenging the status quo. But before 1981 Mary’s occupation was raising her two sons. “I didn’t stop to think what might be involved, but then I never thought that I would fail.” This guides our actions as we strive for excellence in everything we do, while never compromising quality. Just as she did.<\/p>\n                        <p>“I’m impulsive” said Mary. And she had to be when opening a tiny 13 by 12 foot bakeshop, during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. All the while claiming the first of its kind in the world, and defending her lifelong passion from traditionalists who prefer unadulterated shortbread. “Oh, no. All my stuff is quite perfect.” She had quipped. And we still vow to break rules gently and generously, and face every challenge with strength and sweetness, fortitude, and fun as we continue on in the spirit of Mary. Because if she could operate all on her own for two and half decades, moving from under the marquee of Toronto’s Capitol Theatre, to the Western edge of Leslieville then we believe that you have to be Brave to be the best.<\/p>\n                        <p>Okay you can open your eyes now. Go bring someone joy. That’s in our DNA just as much as real creamery butter is.<\/p>\n                    <\/div>\n                    <a href=\"https:\/\/marymacleod.com\/pages\/shortbread-shop\">SHOP ALL<\/a>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"story2-line\">\n        <\/div>\n    \n        <div id=\"story2\">\n            <div class=\"inner\">\n                <div class=\"front\">\n                    <h2>TIMELESS<\/h2>\n                <\/div>\n                <div class=\"back\">\n                    <h2>TIMELESS<\/h2>\n                    <div class=\"txt-container\">\n                        <p>We humbly continue with our 40th anniversary celebrations and pay homage to our bread and butter… a timeless cookie, shortbread.
